# 4-pointer-Bubble-Selection-Sort

This is an test algorithm that implements the two approach of a buuble and selection sort using 4 pointers

## Results

with this tests we can create an optimized alogrithm than the optmized bubblesort,
but it doesnt compare to the STL sort algorithm, the results are below

- Time taken by bubble_selection is : 0.449637 sec
- Time taken by sort is : 0.001989100 sec
- Time taken by bubble_sort is : 0.617849900 sec
