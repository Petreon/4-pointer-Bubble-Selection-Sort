# 4-pointer-Bubble-Selection-Sort

This is an test algorithm that implements the two approach of a buuble and selection sort using 4 pointers

## Results

with this tests we can create an optimized alogrithm than the optmized bubblesort,
but it doesnt compare to the STL sort algorithm, the results are below the test was made with an 10000 array elements

Time taken by bubble_selection is : 0.442716 sec
Time taken by sort is : 0.002159000 sec
Time taken by bubble_sort is : 0.618514000 sec
Time taken by bubble_selectionV2 is : 0.186595300 sec

the V2 algorithm enhance the bubble sort performance in 3,3x an 300% perfomance gain!!
